A program that plays checkers.

## Checkers
Checkers (also known as Draughts) is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 board.

### Basics:
Players: 2 (traditionally Red vs. Black)
Pieces: Each player begins with 12 pieces placed on dark squares.
Objective: Capture all opponent pieces or block them so they can't move.
### Rules:
Pieces move diagonally forward onto unoccupied squares.
Capturing: If an opponent's piece is diagonally adjacent with an empty square immediately beyond, you must jump and capture it.
Multiple jumps are possible and mandatory if available.
Pieces reaching the opposite end become "kings" (can move diagonally forward and backward).
### Winning:
A player wins by capturing all opponent pieces or leaving them with no legal moves.
